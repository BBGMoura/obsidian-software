## Time Complexity
1. O(1) — Constant Time: The algorithm’s running time does not depend on the size of the input; it performs a fixed number of operations.
2. O(log n) — Logarithmic Time: The algorithm’s running time grows logarithmically with the size of the input.
3. O(n) — Linear Time: The algorithm’s running time scales linearly with the size of the input.
4. O(n log n) — Linearithmic Time: The algorithm’s running time grows in proportion to n times the logarithm of n.
5. O(n²) — Quadratic Time: The algorithm’s running time is directly proportional to the square of the input size.
6. O(n^2) — Exponential Time: The algorithm’s running time doubles with each increase in the input size.

## Space Complexity
1. O(1) — Constant Space: The algorithm uses a fixed amount of memory that does not depend on the input size.
2. O(n) — Linear Space: The algorithm’s memory usage grows linearly with the input size.
3. O(n²) — Quadratic Space: The algorithm’s memory usage increases proportionally to the square of the input size.
