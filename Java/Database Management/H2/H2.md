H2 is a database type. It is a relational database written entirely in Java. It can run on the same kind of infrastructure as your application and can run entirely "in-memory". This makes it easy to use to test your Spring Boot application on your machine, without having to obtain a database server from elsewhere.

To connect you can embedded H2 database using Spring Data JPA, application properties need to be updated.  The type of information stored inside property files include:
- database URL
- number of logs the application should produce
- the port the application runs on 

When the Spring Boot application starts, it will check the properties file, located at **src/main/resources/application.properties**, for configurations. 

Example (plants.db is the database) :
``` properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:~/plants  
spring.datasource.driverClassName=org.h2.Driver
```

To connect to the H2 databases, we must import the following dependency:

``` xml
<dependency>  
    <groupId>com.h2database</groupId>  
    <artifactId>h2</artifactId>  
    <scope>runtime</scope>  
</dependency>
```
