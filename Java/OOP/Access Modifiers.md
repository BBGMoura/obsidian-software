All definitions inside a class can be modified with the following keywords to adjust how the outside world interacts with them.

`public` - All classes can access the member.
`protected` - Only classes in the same package or a subclass can access the member.
`private` - The member is only visible from inside the class containing the definition.

**Note: If they're omitted, classes in the same package can access the member. but subclasses cannot.**
