A Regular Expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.

Java does not have a built-in Regular Expression class, but we can import the `java.util.regex` package to work with regex.
Includes the following classes:
- `Pattern` class - defines a pattern
- `Matcher` class - used to search for the pattern
- `PatternSyntaxException` class - indicates syntax error in a regular expression pattern
