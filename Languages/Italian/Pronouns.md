Unlike in English, Italian pronouns are optional.  There are two different ways of saying “you”: formal and informal. If a person is a stranger or older than you, it’s appropriate to use _Lei_  for “you are.” However, if you know that person fairly well or if they’re younger, you would probably use _Tu ._

| Io      | I            |     
| Tu      | You          |     
| Lui/Lei | He/She       |     
| Noi     | We           |     
| Voi     | You/ You all |  
| Loro    |        They      |
