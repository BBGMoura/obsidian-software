HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is used to structure request and responses over the internet. 

The transfer of resources happens using TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). TCP manages channels between your browser and the server. HTTP is the command language that the devices on both sides of the connection must follow to communicate.
