## Notes

## DTO
model and DTOs are interchangeable names. QAs they are both data transfer objects. Only the Entity talks to the database.

DTO is used to hold data in the controller and service layer.

A DTO class example using lombok annotation:

``` java
@Getter  
@Setter  
public class PropertyDTO {  
    private String title;  
    private String description;  
    private String ownerName;  
    private String ownerEmail;  
    private Double price;  
    private String address;  
}
```

You can use **@JsonProperty** to map the name of the fields of an object to a diff name for example:

``` java
public class CalculatorDTO {
	@JsonProperty("num")
	private Double num1;
}
```

This makes it so when a http request is sent with a JSON body, if it contains "num", this will be mapped to num1 field in the CalculatorDTO object.
