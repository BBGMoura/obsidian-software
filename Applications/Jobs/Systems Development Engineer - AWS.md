Key job responsibilities  
WHAT DOES A SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT ENGINEER DO AT AMAZON?  
  
On a typical day engineers might dive deep into understanding the root cause of customer issue, investigate why a metric is trending the wrong way, consult with top engineers at Amazon, or discuss radical new approaches to automate operational issues.  
  
Our systems development engineering roles help engineers develop a broad range of skills. Experienced systems development engineers often have leadership impact on their teams by becoming subject matter experts on several services. They develop, build, deploy, operate, sustain, and grow the services in cloud production environments. They are able to utilize trends and metrics to identify opportunities for improvements. They help develop and refine procedures used by their team and internal customers. They are able to develop at a high standard and can deal with new and ambiguous problem domains, while consistently delivering customer impacting change.
