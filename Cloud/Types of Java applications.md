There are different types of server-side Java applications. Being able to differentiate between the different types will help choose a matching cloud solution.

## Monolithic Applications
A monolithic application is an _all in one_ solution that still fits for many projects. It is a good start for prototyping and startups. It is simple to develop, debug, test, and deploy.

Traditionally, monolithic applications run on application servers and scale the entire application as a whole.

## Microservices
In a cross-functional team, you can deliver features as independently as possible. Each team should be responsible for its own dedicated part of the software. 

## Batch jobs
Some applications are intended to run briefly. They execute a particular workload, then exit rather than wait for requests or user input. 

Batch jobs are a solution for this use case. Even though some batches can last for hours, sometimes jobs need to run once or at regular, scheduled interviews.

## Serverless architectures 
Functions are executed only on an event. A function is "triggered" by a specific type of event. Supported triggers include responding to changes in data, responding to messages, running on a schedule, or receiving an HTTP request.
