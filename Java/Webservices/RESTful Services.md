A webservice is a collection of open protocols and standards used for exchanging data between applications or systems.

REST -> representation state transfer.

REST uses several representations to represent a resource. Such as text, JSON, XML.

Webservices based of REST Architecture are known as restful webservices. These web services use HTTP methods to implement the concept of REST architecture. A RESTful webservice usually defines a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) a service, provides resource representation such as JSON and a set of HTTP methods.

REST webservices use HTTP protocol for data communication.

A RESTful webservice should not keep client state on server. It is called stateless. One request will not know about the other. It is responsibility of the client to pass context using a session identifier.
