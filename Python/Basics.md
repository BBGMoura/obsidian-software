## Comments
Python interprets anything after # as a comment.

``` python
# this is a comment in python
```

## Print
In Python, the `print()` function is used to tell a computer to print to the console.

``` python
print("Hello World!")
```

## Indentation
Python uses indentation for blocks, instead of curly braces. Both tabs and spaces are supported, but the standard indentation requires standard Python code to use four spaces.

``` python
x = 1
if x == 1 :
    # indented four spaces
    print("x is 1.")
```
