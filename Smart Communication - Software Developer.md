**Who are you?**

You love the confidence you get from a thorough test suite and build pipeline.- You’re comfortable discussing requirements with the product management team, throwing your own ideas into the mix and constructively engaging to iterate on requirements and deliver the maximum value for the effort expended.- You like working in an Agile development environment and take responsibility for getting things done as part of a team. You want to be the best you can be and embrace the chance to learn and adapt. You almost always get done what you say you will, and if you don’t you take the time to learn from the experience.
