When two numbers are added together in denary (number system which uses 1-9. base 10) , we take the first number, add the second number to it and get an answer.

When we add two binary (base 2) numbers, the process is different.

There are four rules that need to be followed:
 1. 0 + 0 = 0 
 2. 1 + 0 = 1
 3. 1 + 1 = 10 (represents binary 2)
 4. 1 + 1 + 1 = 11 (represents binary 3)

Example:\

Lets add `0101 0011` and `0111 0110`

Start from the right. For example:

1 + 0 = 1
1 + 1 = 10
so, the one is carried forward 
0 + 1 + 1 = 10
carry over the 1 again
0 + 0 + 1 = 1
and so on:
