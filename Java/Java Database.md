## Introduction
Java is a compiled programming language. This means that the code is transformed into byte code by a compiler before it is executed by the  **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**. The compiling process catches mistakes **before** the computer runs our code.

The **Java Runtime Environment ( JRE)**,  is an application that runs Java applications.  Java is not compiled directly to machine code, it is compiled to Java bytecode. This is platform independent. The JRE executes the compiled Java bytecode.

The **Java Development Kit (JDK)**  is a set of tools for Java software development. It includes the JRE, the java compiler, a debugger, and tools for documenting, bench marking, and analysing Java code.

To build a Java application that can run on the JRE, we use the JDK. Specifically, the `javac` executable (Java Compiler) compiles our Java code to **bytecode**.

The JRE consists of three things:
1. The JVM
2. Many pre-built Java libraries -- Our bytecode will load code from these libraries.
3. Plug-ins and utilities to help deploy and start Java applications.
The JVM is a very important part of the JRE, but it's not the only part.

The **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**, is the application that executes bytecode. Java is know for the JVM. This ensures the same Java code can be run on different operating systems and platforms. Each platform has a custom JVM since the JVM translates bytecode to platform-specific machine code.
