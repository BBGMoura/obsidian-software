#### Tell me about yourself?
my name is bruna and 
i went to university in sout bank university for mechanical engineering. i graduted with a first clas
I hold a 1st Class Master’s degree in Mechanical Engineering, graduating at the top of my class and with the highest grade in my final year project. During university, I discovered my passion for coding in a robotics module, which inspired me to pursue a career in software development. To transition into tech, I completed an intensive bootcamp, where I gained experience building RESTful APIs with Java and Spring, managing relational databases using SQL, and developing front-end applications with JavaScript and React, and containerization using Docker. Following this, I joined the graduate scheme at FSB Technology Ltd, a sports betting and casino company. There, I applied these technologies throughout the full software development lifecycle, working on both the front end and back end. My responsibilities included designing, implementing, and maintaining code, participating in Agile practices like sprint planning, code reviews, documentation, and testing. I also contributed to support tasks, resolving high-priority bugs, and took part in releases.

A key part of my role involved collaborating with stakeholders, product teams, QA, and fellow engineers to ensure knowledge sharing and find the best solutions to issues. As I near the end of my graduate scheme, I’m looking for an opportunity where I can work with more modern technologies and more modern pratcices. Specifically, I’d like to expand my experience in DevOps, learning tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud technologies. I believe that embracing a DevOps mindset, with its focus on continuous integration and deployment, is key for a developer to allow us to develop production ready code, to ship code off faster to receive feedback and work on iterations of the solution.

### Why do you want to work for us?

The Workshop stands out to me because of its work in the sports betting and casino space—an industry where I have direct experience and have thoroughly enjoyed working. This field has provided me with valuable business insights and highlighted its significant growth potential. There is considerable global demand for technical services that deliver innovative sports betting solutions, making it a sector I am eager to continue in.

This role excites me because it merges my industry experience with the chance to delve into the fintech world. Venturing into fintech aligns with my career aspirations, as finance is integral to our global economy. Financial systems impact virtually every industry, and fintech is crucial for advancing and building a global economy.

What makes this opportunity particularly appealing is the focus on blockchain technology. Blockchain offers substantial benefits to the sports betting industry, particularly with its immutable nature, which ensures secure transaction tracking. The potential of blockchain extends well beyond sports betting, and I am impressed by The Workshop’s commitment to leveraging blockchain and expanding its solutions to a wider audience.
#### What interests you about the financial industry?

The financial industry fascinates me for several reasons. Firstly, it's at the heart of our global economy; financial systems and the decisions made within them ripple out to impact virtually every other industry. Understanding these complex, interconnected systems can provide fascinating insights into not just the economy but also social and geopolitical trends.

Secondly, the constant evolution and innovation in the finance industry keep it challenging and intellectually stimulating. Whether it's the emerging trends in fintech, the increasing emphasis on sustainability and ESG investing, or the exciting developments around cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, there is always something new to learn and understand.

Lastly, a career in finance offers the opportunity to make a tangible difference - from helping individuals plan their financial future, aiding businesses in making strategic decisions, to supporting economic growth and development. The role that the finance industry plays in shaping our communities and our future is of significant interest to me.

### What do you think you bring to the company?

I bring valuable experience from the sports betting and casino industry, where I’ve worked directly with businesses providing sports betting solutions. This background allows me to apply both my practical knowledge and business logic effectively. My genuine passion for creating impactful user experiences is evident from my previous role, where I saw firsthand the positive effects of well-designed solutions.

I possess a strong growth mindset and am committed to continuous learning and excellence. My proactive approach is reflected in my past experiences, such as working on complex projects like decoupling our sportsbook from account management. In that project, I integrate a third-party account management system, utilizing Test-Driven Development principles with JUnit and Mockito. This effort played a key role in retaining a major business partnership, demonstrating the tangible impact of my contributions.

Collaboration is central to my work ethos. I strongly believe in knowledge sharing and have actively promoted practices like pair programming to onboard new team members and share code structure and business logic. In my most recent project, which involved transitioning to an event-driven architecture using ActiveMQ and MongoDB, I proactively engaged with engineers and the product team to understand requirements and achieve our goals. This project, which included consolidating multiple third-party sports data feeds into a single feed, significantly reduced company expenditure.


-> maybe saying too much try condense mor like tell less stories. maybe just say specifically what would make me stand out
- i have sportsbetting experience
- my engineering manager vouches for my collaboration
- my team mates ovuhc for my growth mindset and proactives

### Overview of my skills
I worked both on backend and frontend. 
On the backend, I developed, maintained and tested restful applications using Java and Spring, PostgreSQL. One proect that I worked on seperating our sportsbook from the personal account management. I had to implementing an api which allowed us to use any other third part account mangement systems. I like to take a test  driven development approach with JUnit and Mockito.

I also worked with event-driven architecture and messaging systems such as ActiveMQ. My most recent project consisted of creating market and pricing analysis system which was built on ActiveMQ to communicate between different applications. I also had to use MongoDB which was used to store the data feed, to analyse data structure.

I used git for version control and jenkins for CI/CD pipelines in the releases i took part in. I also used dtatadog for log monitoring on production.

On the frontend, I used Javascript, React, CSS and HTML to create features for a web application using figma designs and change requests. One of my most notable projects on the frontend included cleaning up memory leaks in the react application which resulted in reducing memry usage and faster initial loading times for our login app.

ALso collaborated with global cross functional teams to partake in agile practices such as daily stand ups, pair programming, code reviews and writing documentation.
