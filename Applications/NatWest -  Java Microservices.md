#### Overview 
Business models and customer behaviours continue to evolve rapidly as the role of technology – in how our customers communicate, shop, do business and bank – continues to grow and progress at pace, with more sophisticated technology becoming available, in particular in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). We recognise the growing role of technology for our customers, suppliers and colleagues in everything from remote working and learning, to accessing and delivering goods and services.
#### Our response 
We continued the digital transformation of our systems in 2023 to make it easier for customers to access our services when and where they want. Through our payments service Tyl, we were one of the first banks to offer Apple and Android Tap to Pay, a low-cost service removing the need for any hardware to accept payments. For our Retail Banking customers, we further developed our mobile banking app and we’re using data ethically to better understand our customers’ needs and behaviours. This is to help keep their money safe, as well as offer personalised insights to support their financial wellbeing. We’re also focusing on how we use AI and machine-learning technologies safely and ethically to improve the support we can offer to our customers and ensure that our use of data continues to be secure, accountable, fair and ethical. In September 2023, we announced the expansion of our collaboration with Amazon Web Services Inc. to accelerate the use of, and develop, responsible AI products to help customers manage their financial wellbeing through personalised support. Through the collaboration, we have developed AI models that analyse customer behaviour and help us to detect if customers are being scammed, allowing us to intervene more quickly and reduce financial loss. We also, announced in November 2023, a collaboration with IBM on a generative AI initiative with enhancements to our virtual assistant Cora. This will provide our customers access to a wider range of information through conversational interactions with Cora+. We aim to harness the power of responsible and ethical AI to form part of our wider strategy, collaborating with IBM and other experts to help our customers achieve financial wellbeing through personalised support.



-> natwest will be the first in the uk to deploy generative ai with a virtuala ssistant enabling a sfae , intuitive and accessible experience in its digital service
