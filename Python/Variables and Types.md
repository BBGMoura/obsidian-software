Python is completely object oriented, and not "statically typed". You do not need to declare variables before using them, or declare their type. Every variable in Python is an object.

## Numbers
Python supports two types of numbers - integers(whole numbers) and floating point numbers(decimals). /it also supports complex numbers.

To declare integers:
``` python
myint = 7
```

To declare floating point number:
``` python
myfloat = 7.0

myfloat = float(7) 
print(myfloat) # prints 7.0
```

## Strings
Strings are defined either with a single quote or a double quote. The double quptes make it easy to include apostrophes.
``` python
mystring = 'hello'

mystring = "hello"
```

There are additional variations on defining strings that make it easier to include things such as carriage returns, backslashes and Unicode characters.
