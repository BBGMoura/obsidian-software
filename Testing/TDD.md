TDD is a software development approach where tests are written before writing the actual implementation code. It follows a cycle: **Red-Green-Refactor**. 

### TDD Cycle: Red-Green-Refactor
1. **Red**: Write failing test that defines a function or improvements of a function
2. **Green** : Write the minimum amount of code necessary to pass the test
3. **Refactor**: Refactor the code to improve its structure, keeping the tests passing.
