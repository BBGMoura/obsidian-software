I believe I am the perfect match for this role due to my unique experience and skills developed over two years as a Software Developer designing, fixing, and creating software that utilised Java and Spring to build complex RESTful APIs in the sports betting and gambling industry. This experience stands out because it has equipped me with the skills and ability needed to work in high-stress environments for international companies that handle financial services daily. I understand the demands and pressures associated with high-stakes financial roles, making me the strongest candidate for this position.

For instance, during my time at FSB Technology, I closely collaborated with the product and design departments to resolve a critical bug that caused customer deposits to be taken twice randomly. This issue was crucial as it negatively impacted the customer experience and eroded trust. By successfully fixing this bug, I significantly improved customer satisfaction, evidenced by the fact that 70% of the customers who had deactivated their accounts due to the bug reopened them after we communicated the resolution. This experience highlights my ability to work in high-pressure financial environments and prioritise customer satisfaction, which aligns with Lloyds' values of putting people first.

My long-term career goals align perfectly with the job description. I aspire to grow within my role, continuously learning and leveraging newer technologies such as microservices and cloud solutions. Having worked in an environment with a monolithic architecture, where tightly coupled code led to tedious processes and cascading errors, I am eager to transition to a microservices-based approach. This transition is appealing because it promotes scalability, flexibility, and efficient management of complex systems, addressing issues I encountered regularly in my previous role.

I highly enjoy collaborative teamwork, as demonstrated in my previous role where I actively engaged in pair programming, code reviews, and overall team collaboration. Currently, I am working alongside a colleague to integrate an external personal account management system into our RESTful API. Our collaboration enabled us to complete the first phase of this integration in one month, ahead of the expected six weeks. Additionally, I have mentored a new junior developer, helping them understand our platform and the technologies we use better. This experience underscores the importance of knowledge sharing in building an efficient and cohesive team. Lloyds' job offer emphasises the need for mentorship and teamwork skills, which I possess and am confident would be a great asset to this team. This aligns with Lloyds' value of Trust, which I consider essential for team and company progress.

Thank you for considering my application. I am confident I am a fit for the role and look forward to hearing back.
